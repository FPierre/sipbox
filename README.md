# sipbox

> Handle SIP calls with an self-hosted Asterisk server

Heavily inspired by:

* [Vue.js and Electron](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-desktop-quiz-application-using-vue-js-and-electron)

Use:

* [SIP.js](https://sipjs.com/)

## Build Setup

```bash

```

```bash
# Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

```

```bash
# Build for production with minification
yarn un build
```

```bash
# Build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report
```

```bash
# Run unit tests
yarn run unit
```

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test
```
